# qrCodeReaderWriter

## TODO:
* ~~Access front camera~~
* Implement [asking user for permission to use camera](https://github.com/ParkSangGwon/TedPermission)
* ~~Test if QR code gets recognized through front camera~~ (It does!)
* ~~Implement beep sound as feedback for qr code recognition~~
* ~~Disable screen rotation~~
* Implement [Android Image Dialog/Popup](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7693633/android-image-dialog-popup) and test if it works as expected.
* In case, above Image Dialog does not work, find another way to display qr code while having the camera open.
* Log logic stuff
