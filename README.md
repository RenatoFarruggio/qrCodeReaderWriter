## TODO:
* ~~Access front camera~~
* Implement [asking user for permission to use camera](https://github.com/ParkSangGwon/TedPermission)
* Test if QR code gets recognized through front camera
* Disable screen rotation
* Implement [Android Image Dialog/Popup](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7693633/android-image-dialog-popup) and test if it works as expected.
* In case, above Image Dialog does not work, find another way to display qr code while having the camera open.
* Log logic stuff
